I can't help but feel [bpcmusic's telex](https://github.com/bpcmusic/telex/blob/master/commands.md) modules are drifting into obscurity and I think that's really unfortunate. These straightforward modules — in conjunction with teletype — helped me understand what was actually happening in my synthesizer which ultimately led me to developing a musical perspective. I want other to have that, too.

This mod grants control over TXO+'s core features in the params menu and I think shows the amazing capabilities of this open source project. I hope inspires you to explore what's possible.

Telex forever 🙇

### In Maiden
`;install https://github.com/brokyo/norns-telexo`

### Trigger Options
- Four independent Euclidean rhythm sections with **clock mod** and **rotation** options
 
### CV Options
- Four independent CV controls supporting **LFOs** or **Tuned Oscillators** 
- Each CV port has individual control over **time**, **depth**, **phase**, **waveshape**, **rectification**

### Using It
- Once you load a script the CV and TR ports will be selectable in the PARAMS menu under the TELEXo heading.
- In CV `Mode` flips between “LFO” and “Oscillator” and shows the associated params
- CV `Type` intepolates between sine (0) > triangle (100) > saw (200) > pulse (300) > noise (400)
