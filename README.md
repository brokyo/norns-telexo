[bpcmusic's telex](https://github.com/bpcmusic/telex/blob/master/commands.md) modules are an important part of my modular experience. In conjunction with teletype these modules helped me understand what was actually happening in my synthesizer and ultimately led me to developing a musical perspective. I want to bring some of that straightforward control to the Norns ecosystem.

This mod grants control over TXO+'s core features in the params menu and I think shows the amazing capabilities of this open source project. I hope inspires you to explore what's possible.

Telex forever 🙇

### In Maiden
`;install https://github.com/brokyo/norns-telexo`

### Trigger Options
- Four independent trigger sections with **clock mod** and **probability** settings
- Can be run as a Euclidean rhythm section
- Or as clock div/mult 
 
### CV Options
- Four independent CV controls supporting **LFOs** or **Tuned Oscillators** 
- Each CV port has individual control over **time**, **depth**, **phase**, **waveshape**, **rectification**

### Using It
- Once you load a script the CV and TR ports will be selectable in the PARAMS menu under the TELEXo heading.
- In CV `Mode` flips between “LFO” and “Oscillator” and shows the associated params
- CV `Type` intepolates between sine (0) > triangle (100) > saw (200) > pulse (300) > noise (400)
