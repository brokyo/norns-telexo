This mod offers system-level control over four ports which can be used as **LFOs** or **Tuned Oscillators** with individual control over **time**/**depth**/**phase**/**waveshape**/**rectification**.

The telex + teletype combo was the first thing that helped me *make sense* of modular. I can't help but  feel the telex stuff is drifting a bit into obscurity. Hopefully this fairly straightforward implementation of some of TXO+'s core features inspires others to explore what's possible.

I travel somewhat regularly with a small case and this functionality make everything so much more pleasant. Maybe you'll feel the same.

TXO forever ðŸ™‡
